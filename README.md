## The Task
The challenge is to build a machine learning model to classify images of "La Eterna". This can be done in a variety of ways. For this tutorial we will be focusing on building an image classification using artificial neural nets (ANN).

## The Data 
The data is split into a training and a submission set. The repo includes two labeled folders in the Test folder. The folder labeled "la_eterna" includes the pictures of la eterna that Eva captured. The other folder labeled "other_flowers" includes pictures of other flowers that are not la eterna. We will use this data to build our classifier. Each of the images has been formatted to the dimensions (224,224, 3) for the analysis.
